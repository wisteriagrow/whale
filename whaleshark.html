                <dd>They draw in big gulps of water, close their
                    mouths, and expel the water gradually through their gills. </dd>

                <dt>They Have Thousands Of Teeth</dt>
                <dd>Though Whale Sharks are not predators
                    like the Great White, they do have small little teeth for
                    when they encounter small fish.</dd>

                <dt>Their Lifespan Is Really Long</dt>
                <dd>The majority of sharks live up to 50 years,

                <dd>Humans have fingerprints that are unique to each person.
                    Likewise, whale sharks' spots are unique to each shark.</dd>

                <dt>Whale Sharks Are Endangered</dt>
                <dd>Because of bycatch and fisheries,
                    Whale Sharks population has greatly
                    decreased and have been declared endangered! <a
